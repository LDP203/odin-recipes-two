    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An all time classic and perfect for a chilly, winter night.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium leeks, dark green stems removed
        <li>1/2 large white onion, chopped
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
        <li>1 tablespoon flour, use AP gluten free flour for GF
        <li>1 tbsp butter
        <li>4 cups chicken stock, use vegetable broth for vegetarians
        <li>1/2 cup 2% milk
        <li>salt and fresh pepper
    </li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash leeks very carefully to remove all grit. I usually cut them horizontally and separate the rings to make sure no dirt remains. Coarsely chop them when washed.
        <li>In a medium soup pot, melt butter and add flour on low flame.
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, mix well. This will thicken your soup and give it a wonderful flavor.
        <li>Add chicken stock, leeks, onion, potatoes and bring to a boil.
        <li>Cover and simmer on low for about 20-25 minutes, until potatoes are soft.
        <li>Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until smooth adding the milk and adjusting salt and pepper to taste.
        <li>Serve immediately.
    </li></ol>
